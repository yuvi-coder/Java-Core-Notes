class and objects :

class : 
Class is the blueprint of an object. It is used to create objects.
No memory is allocated when a class is declared.
A Class in Java can contain:
                                    1. Data member
                                    2. Method
                                    3. Constructor
                                    4. Nested Class
                                    5. Interface
                                    
Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).

Class keyword: Class keyword is used to create a class.

Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).

Superclass (if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded
by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by
the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class
can implement more than one interface.
Body: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.

Subclass in Java :
1. A subclass is a class that inherits from another class, known asthe superclass or parent class.
2. The subclass can access and use the properties
(fields) and methods of the superclass, but it can also add its own fields and
methods or override existing ones.
3. Inheritance allows you to create a new class that reuses the code from an existing class.
The extends keyword is used to define a subclass in Java.

objects : 
An object is an instance of the class.
Memory is allocated as soon as an object is created.

Java object consists : 
                                   1. State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects 
                                   the properties of an object.
                                   2. Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also
                                   reflects the response of an object with other objects.
                                   3. Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object
                                   to interact with other objects.
