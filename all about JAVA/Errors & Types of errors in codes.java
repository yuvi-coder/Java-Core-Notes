/* In compiler design, errors are broadly classified into three main categories:
1. compile-time errors - Compile-time errors occur during the compilation process and include lexical, syntax, and semantic errors. 
2. runtime errors - Runtime errors happen during program execution and can be due to various reasons like invalid input or system issues.
3. logical errors - Logical errors, on the other hand, involve flaws in the program's logic and are not detected by the compiler but manifest during program execution.

1. Compile-time Errors:
Lexical Errors:
These errors occur when the compiler cannot recognize a sequence of characters as a valid token (like keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
For example, a misspelled keyword or an invalid character sequence can lead to a lexical error. 
Syntax Errors:
These errors occur when the program's code does not adhere to the grammatical rules of the programming language.
Examples include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect use of operators. 
Semantic Errors:
These errors occur when the program's code is syntactically correct but has logical or meaningful inconsistencies.
For instance, using an undeclared variable or performing an operation that violates type rules can lead to semantic errors. 
2. Runtime Errors:
Runtime Errors:
These errors occur during the execution of the program and are often caused by issues like invalid input data, insufficient memory, or division by zero. 
Arithmetic Errors:
A specific type of runtime error related to arithmetic operations, such as attempting to divide by zero. 
3. Logical Errors:
Logical Errors:
These errors involve flaws in the program's algorithm or design, leading to incorrect output or behavior even if the program compiles and runs successfully.
For example, using the wrong comparison operator or an incorrect loop condition can result in a logical error. 
Type Errors:
These errors occur when an operation is performed on a variable that is not of the expected type, according to a post on LinkedIn. */
