*"Java"*


# Platform Independence :

1. Java follows the Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) philosophy.
2. Java programs are compiled into an intermediate form called *bytecode*.
3. This bytecode can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
4. The JVM is platform-specific, meaning that it adapts Java programs
to run on different operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.


# Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection) :

1. Java handles memory management through automatic garbage collection.
2. This means the JVM automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation,
freeing up memory that is no longer in use.
3. This eliminates the need for manual memory management (such as the use of pointers in C/C++).


# Multithreading :   // https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/

1. Java provides built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to
write highly responsive, parallel programs.
2. Threads are lightweight processes that can run concurrently.
3. Java simplifies multithreading by providing a rich set of APIs for creating and managing threads.


# Security :

* Java was designed with security in mind.
* It runs in a "sandbox" to prevent untrusted code from causing harm. - < Java Sandbox > // know more.

""A sandbox is a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and
outright experimentation from the production environment or repository
in the context of software development, including web development,
automation, revision control, configuration management (see also change management), 
and patch management.""
