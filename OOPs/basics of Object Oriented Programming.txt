OOPS : Object Oriented Programming

1. Encapsulation: Bundling the data (variables)
and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.


2. Inheritance: Allowing a new class (subclass) to take properties
and behavior (methods) from an existing class (superclass).


3. Polymorphism: A mechanism that allows you to perform
a single action in different ways.


4. Abstraction: Hiding the complexity of the system by providing only
essential information, allowing users to interact with the system at a higher level.
